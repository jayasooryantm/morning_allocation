### Python Automation Project.

Python automation workflow for the process of allocating scripts to examiners with rule based system.

#### About
Using the power of pandas and python programming language our day to day task can be easily automated nd reduce the overhead in the workspace. This program is made for resource allocation of examiners at Cambridge University Press and Assessment. The process of reviewing the answer sheets need alot of preparation especially when it comes to large scale, before allocating a reviewer there are several criteria such as if the reviewer is involved in question paper preparation they can not review the answers, avoiding allocation if they are not specialised in subject, avoiding over allocation to a reviewer, etc. it is a tedious task when it comes to manual allocation, it could take an hour or two to finish it. The automation makes it easier when the rules are specified. This program is build to allocate suitable reviwer for each subjects/component.
